## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the blanks.
3. Build the project with `yarn build` and serve the public directory with `yarn start`.

That's it.

## Developing

Run both `yarn start` to serve the public directory and `yarn build --watch` to rebuild the js bundle when the source changes.
